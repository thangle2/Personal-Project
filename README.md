## App name: Piggy $aver :pig:

## :page_facing_up: General Info 
The goal of this application is to create a money management tool for people who want to stay on track with their finances. It provides an overall summary of how much you can spend on a weekly basis, what you are spending, and how much your are saving. (Currency Option Available: USD Only)
## ðŸ¤¨ Why?
- Every January, a new survey presents the same data as the last one, stating "x% of Americans Living Paycheck-to-Paycheck." In  2019-20, the numbers reached a high of 49-59%, with 62% of households reporting no savings/emergency funds. These seemingly inconspicuous numbers turned into reality for Federal workers during the government shutdown of 2019. Meanwhile, the impact has stringently grown for workers in all sectors during the pandemic. The best solution is to make more money, save more, live below your means, but that's easier said than done. With the increasing uncertainty of financial security, managing money has become a necessity. However, starting the habit of budgeting early on has been troublesome for young-adults due to limited to no personal finance education; this is true for even recent graduates joining the workforce. 
	Our App makes it easier for its users to take control of your finances and gets the user started with a simple plan for the users to manage their cash flow. Piggy $aver resolves this by letting the users take a survey, instead of the hassle for one to set up a complicated spreadsheet. The App assesses and allocates funds for the necessities (like emergency fund/savings) over the superfluous expenditure, focusing on subscriptions. Our aim with this App is to reduce the barrier of entry for anyone attempting to habitually budget. In the day and age of 10-second TikTok clips and 10-minute Youtube videos, the Minimum Viable Effort for Piggy $aver is a 5-minute survey, making it easier for the user to assess their financial health -- "You can fix what you can see." Users will be warned of overspending on subscriptions and would be presented with the percentage of overspending in that category. The aim to focus on subscriptions is to counteract the strategy of subscriptions directly- a reminder/ visual access to it makes an active attempt for the users to not avoid renewals. Rather than letting another yearâ€™s resolution fail, the User can now strive for a new habit with a little assistance!
